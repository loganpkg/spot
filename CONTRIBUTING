I am happy to receive contributions to this repository, so long as you agree
to release your work under the ISC license. If you make non-trivial changes
to an existing file, then feel free to add your name with mine in the
copyright notice (with the correct year). Simply add the ISC license with your
name (and the year) to new files that you make. You can contact me if you want
to gain direct access to the repository.

Enjoy,
